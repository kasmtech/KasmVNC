# KasmVNC - Linux Web Remote Desktop

<a href="https://kasmweb.com"><img src="https://kasm-static-content.s3.amazonaws.com/logo_kasm.png" width="300"><a/>

KasmVNC provides remote web-based access to a Desktop or application. While VNC is in the name, KasmVNC differs from other VNC variants such as TigerVNC, RealVNC, and TurboVNC. KasmVNC has broken from the RFB specification which defines VNC, in order to support modern technologies and increase security. KasmVNC is accessed by users from any modern browser and does not support legacy VNC viewer applications. KasmVNC uses a modern YAML based configuration at the server and user level, allowing for ease of management.

[Kasm Technologies](https://www.kasmweb.com) developed Kasm Workspaces, the Containerized Streaming Platform. Kasm has open-sourced the Workspace docker images, which include containerized [full desktops and apps](https://github.com/kasmtech/workspaces-images) and [base images](https://github.com/kasmtech/workspaces-core-images) intended for developers to create customized streaming containers. These containers can be used standalone or within the [Kasm Workspaces Platform](https://www.kasmweb.com) which provides a full Enterprise feature set.

## Documentation

**Do not use the README from the master branch**, unless you are compiling KasmVNC yourself from the tip of master. Use the documentation for your specific release.

  - [KasmVNC 1.0.0 Documentation](https://www.kasmweb.com/kasmvnc/docs/1.0.0/index.html)

  For beta releases prior to version 1.0.0, use the README in this github project on the tagged commit for that release.

## Installation

**You must disconnect and reconnect to the server after installation, for the group membership to apply.**

### Debian/Ubuntu/Kali
```sh
# Please choose the package for your distro here (under Assets):
# https://github.com/kasmtech/KasmVNC/releases
wget <package_url>

sudo apt-get install ./kasmvncserver_*.deb

# Add your user to the ssl-cert group
sudo addgroup $USER ssl-cert
```

### Oracle 8
```sh
# Please choose the package for your distro here (under Assets):
# https://github.com/kasmtech/KasmVNC/releases
wget <package_url>

# Ensure KasmVNC dependencies are available
sudo dnf config-manager --set-enabled ol8_codeready_builder
sudo dnf install oracle-epel-release-el8

sudo dnf localinstall ./kasmvncserver_*.rpm

# Add your user to the kasmvnc-cert group
sudo usermod -a -G kasmvnc-cert $USER
```

### CentOS 7

```sh
# Please choose the package for your distro here (under Assets):
# https://github.com/kasmtech/KasmVNC/releases
wget <package_url>

# Ensure KasmVNC dependencies are available
sudo yum install epel-release

sudo yum install ./kasmvncserver_*.rpm

# Add your user to the kasmvnc-cert group
sudo usermod -a -G kasmvnc-cert $USER
```

## Getting Started

The following examples provide basic usage of KasmVNC with the tools provided. For full documentation on all the utilities and the runtime environment, see our [KasmVNC Documentation](https://www.kasmweb.com/kasmvnc/docs/latest/index.html)

```sh
# Start a session and be guided to setup a user and select a default desktop environment
vncserver

# Start a session with the mate desktop environment
vncserver -select-de mate

# Add a new user with read/write permissions
vncpasswd -u my_username -w -r

# Tail the logs
tail -f ~/.vnc/*.log

# Get a list of current sessions with display IDs
vncserver -list

# Kill the VNC session with display ID :2
vncserver -kill :2
```

## Configuration

KasmVNC is configured via YAML based configurations. The server level configuration is at `/etc/kasmvnc/kasmvnc.yaml`. Edits to this file apply to all users. Individual users can override server global configurations by specifying them in their configuration file at `~/.vnc/kasmvnc.yaml`.

The following configuration shows all default settings. Many of the encoding settings can be overridden by the client, unless the `runtime_configuration.allow_client_to_override_kasm_server_settings` setting is set tot false. By default the client is allowed to modify encoding settings.

For a full description of each setting see the [configuration reference](https://www.kasmweb.com/kasmvnc/docs/latest/configuration.html).
