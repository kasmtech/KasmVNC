# Build a deb/rpm package
```
# builder/build-package <os> <os_codename> <build_tag>
# os_codename is what "lsb_release -c" outputs, e.g. buster, focal.
#
# build_tag allows building multiple versions of deb package (rpm not supported)
# targeting a single distro release (e.g. Ubuntu Bionic). If build_tag is given,
# the package name will include build_tag as part of Debian revision. For
# example:
# * with build_tag: kasmvncserver_0.9.1~beta-1+libjpeg-turbo-latest_amd64.deb
# * without build_tag: kasmvncserver_0.9.1~beta-1_amd64.deb
# You need to have .build and .deb.build for the build_tag.
#
# Packages will be placed under builder/build/

builder/build-package ubuntu bionic
builder/build-package ubuntu focal
builder/build-package debian buster
builder/build-package debian bullseye
builder/build-package kali kali-rolling
builder/build-package centos core # CentOS 7
builder/build-package fedora thirtythree
```

# Build and test a package
```
builder/build-and-test-deb ubuntu focal
builder/build-and-test-rpm centos core
```

Open browser and point to https://localhost:443/ or https://\<ip-address\>:443/

3 default users are created:
* 'foo' with default password 'foobar'. It can use mouse and keyboard.
* 'foo-ro' with default password 'foobar'. It can only view.
* 'foo-owner' with default password 'foobar'. It can manage other users.

# Test a package

If you want to test deb/rpm package you've already built, please use this:
```
builder/test-deb ubuntu focal
```
It will install the package inside a new container and run KasmVNC.

Open browser and point to https://localhost:443/ or https://\<ip-address\>:443/

# Package development

## deb/rpm package building and testing

First, a tarball is built, and then its files are copied to deb/rpm package as
it is being built.
Package testing stage installs the deb/rpm package in a fresh docker container
and runs KasmVNC.

```
builder/build-tarball debian buster
builder/build-deb debian buster
builder/test-deb debian buster
```

Use `build-and-test-deb` to perform the whole dev lifecycle, but to iterate
quickly, you'll need to skip building the tarball (which takes a long time), and
just build your deb/rpm with `build-deb` and test with `test-deb`.

`build-rpm` and `test-rpm` are also available.

## Ensuring packages have all dependencies they need.

If you're working on a deb/rpm package, testing that it has all the necessary
dependencies is done via testing in a barebones environment (read: no XFCE). In
this way we can be sure that runtime dependencies aren't met accidentally by
packages installed with XFCE.

```
builder/test-deb-barebones ubuntu focal
```
# CI development

S3 upload code is extracted to various files in `.ci`. It's possible to iterate
locally by doing stuff like this:

```
bash -c '
. .ci/upload.sh;
prepare_upload_filename "bionic/kasmvncserver_0.9.1~beta-1+libjpeg-turbo-latest_amd64.deb";
echo $upload_filename;'
```

# ARM

KasmVNC is supported on ARM, however, the build process needs to be broken into two parts with one occuring on a x64 system and the other on an ARM system. All our testing and official builds are done on AWS Graviton instances.

### Build www code on x86 System
The www code is webpacked for performance and thus requires building. There are NPM packages, phantomjs, which do not have an ARM build. Therefore, this must be built on x86 and then copied over to the ARM system for final packaging.

```
cd ~/KasmVNC
mkdir builder/www
sudo docker build -t kasmweb/www -f builder/dockerfile.www.build .
sudo docker run --rm -v $PWD/builder/www:/build kasmweb/www:latest
cd builder
tar -zcvf /tmp/kasm_www.tar.gz www
```

Now transfer ```kasm_www.tar.gz``` to the ARM system.

### Build KasmVNC ARM
These instructions assume KasmVNC has been cloned at $HOME and ```kasm_www.tar.gz``` has been placed at $HOME as well, adjust for your environment.

```
cd ~
tar -zxf kasm_www.tar.gz -C KasmVNC/builder/
cd KasmVNC
sudo builder/build-package ubuntu bionic
```
The resulting deb package can be found under ~/KasmVNC/builder/build/bionic
Replace ```bionic``` with ```focal``` to build for Ubuntu 20.04LTS. At this time, only Ubuntu Bionic has been tested, however, other Debian based builds we support should also work.
