Description: VNC server accessible from a web browser
 VNC stands for Virtual Network Computing. It is, in essence, a remote
 display system which allows you to view a computing `desktop' environment
 not only on the machine where it is running, but from anywhere on the
 Internet and from a wide variety of machine architectures.
 .
 KasmVNC has different goals than TigerVNC:
 .
 Web-based - KasmVNC is designed to provide a web accessible remote desktop.
 It comes with a web server and websocket server built in. There is no need to
 install other components. Simply run and navigate to your desktop's URL on the
 port you specify. While you can still tun on the legacy VNC port, it is
 disabled by default.
 .
 Security - KasmVNC defaults to HTTPS and allows for HTTP Basic Auth. VNC
 Password authentication is limited by specification to 8 characters and is not
 suffecient for use on an internet accessible remote desktop. Our goal is to
 create a by default secure, web based experience.
 .
 Simplicity - KasmVNC aims at being simple to deploy and configure.
