Description: KasmVNC provides remote web-based access to a Desktop or application.
  While VNC is in the name, KasmVNC differs from other VNC variants such
  as TigerVNC, RealVNC, and TurboVNC. KasmVNC has broken from the RFB
  specification which defines VNC, in order to support modern technologies
  and increase security. KasmVNC is accessed by users from any modern
  browser and does not support legacy VNC viewer applications. KasmVNC
  uses a modern YAML based configuration at the server and user level,
  allowing for ease of management. KasmVNC is maintained by Kasm
  Technologies Corp, www.kasmweb.com.
